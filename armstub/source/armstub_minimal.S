/**
 * @brief Program Entry Point (_start)
 * @description
 *   This is the entry point of the program. It loads the address of 
 *   the kernel entry point (`kernel_entry32`) into a register and 
 *   transfers control to it.
 * @notes
 *   - The `_start` label is globally accessible to the linker.
 *   - This setup is required for proper handoff to the kernel code.
 * @param kernel_entry32 (address) 
 *   The address of the kernel entry point which is loaded into the register.
 * @return 
 *   No explicit return. The program control is transferred to the kernel 
 *   entry point via the `br` instruction.

/**
 * @brief Literal Pool Section
 * @description
 *   The `.ltorg` directive tells the assembler to output literal 
 *   constants at this point in the code.
 * @notes
 *   - This ensures that any immediate values used in instructions 
 *     are placed into the literal pool.
 * @param None
 * @return 
 *   No return. This is a directive for the assembler to handle literal constants.

 *     the authenticity or integrity of the program stub.
